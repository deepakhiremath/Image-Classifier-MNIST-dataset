# Image Classifor: MNIST dataset

# Problem Statement:
Building a simple CNN-based architecture to classify the 10 digits (0-9) of the MNIST dataset. The objective of this is to become familiar with the process of building CNNs in Keras.

# Steps:
1. Importing libraries and the dataset
2. Data preparation: Train-test split, specifying the shape of the input data etc.
3. Building and understanding the CNN architecture
4. Fitting and evaluating the model
